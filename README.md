# polya-gamma
Efficiently generate samples from the Polya-Gamma distribution using a NumPy/SciPy compatible interface.
![densities](./scripts/density.svg)


## Features
- `polyagamma` is written in C and optimized for performance.
- It is flexible and allows the user to sample using one of 4 available methods.
- Input parameters can be scalars, arrays or both; allowing for easy generation
of multi-dimensional samples without specifying the size.
- Random number generation is thread safe.
- The functional API resembles that of common numpy/scipy functions, therefore making it easy to plugin to
existing libraries.


## Dependencies
- Numpy >= 1.17 


## Installation
To get the latest version of the package, one can install it by downloading the wheel/source distribution 
from the [releases][3] page, or using `pip` with the following shell command:
```shell
$ pip install --pre -U polyagamma
```

Alternatively, once can install from source by cloning the repo. This requires an installation of [poetry][2]
and the following shell commands:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/zoj613/polya-gamma.git
$ cd polya-gamma/
$ poetry install
# add package to python's path
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH 
```

## Example

### Python

```python
import numpy as np
from polyagamma import polyagamma

o = polyagamma()

# Get a 5 by 10 array of PG(1, 2) variates.
o = polyagamma(z=2, size=(5, 10))

# Pass sequences as input. Numpy's broadcasting rules apply here.
h = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [9, 8, 7, 6, 5]]
o = polyagamma(h, 1)

# Pass an output array
out = np.empty(5)
polyagamma(out=out)
print(out)

# one can choose a sampling method from {devroye, alternate, gamma, saddle}.
# If not given, the default behaviour is a hybrid sampler that picks a method
# based on the parameter values.
o = polyagamma(method="devroye")

# We can also use an existing instance of `numpy.random.Generator` as a parameter.
# This is useful to reproduce samples generated via a given seed.
rng = np.random.default_rng(12345)
o = polyagamma(random_state=rng)
```
### C
For an example of how to use `polyagamma` in a C program, see [here][1].
